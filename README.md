# HackDalton: Get a Py 2

## Problem:

I explained the vunerabilities in the Bakery website to my friend, but he disregarded them :(. I explained to him how severe these security isses are, but he didn't believe me. To prove me wrong, he made an "admin" page and hid a flag in there.

## Hints
1. Use what you learned in Get a Py 1 to access the secret key. What can a Flask secret key do?
2. What does a flask secret key have to do with session cookies?

Look at the writeup [here](./WRITEUP.md).
