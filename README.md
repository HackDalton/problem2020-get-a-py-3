# HackDalton: Get a Py 3

## Problem:

My friend still doesn't believe me that his bakery website is insecure. I told him that anyone can access everything on his server, but he still doesn't believe me (even after the whole admin page fiasco). To prove it to him, he hid a flag in a file on his server and wants me to provide it to him.

> Note: If you break something in this problem, please report it immediatly on the [help site](https://help.hackdalton.com). That way, we can fix it and the competition can go on for everyone.

## Hints
1. See if you can access a list of classes that are used in the file
2. Read into the [Popen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen) class in python
